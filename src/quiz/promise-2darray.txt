There's a distinction in how the code executes. When using the setTimeout function, the message "returning from sum" appears before the summing of the array is complete, which shows asynchronous behavior. 
Without the setTimeout, the function completes the array summing before returning, showing synchronous execution.

The version using setTimeout operates similarly to the fetch() API call, as both handle tasks asynchronously. 
However, with fetch(), the callbacks are invoked earlier in the process compared to those delayed by setTimeout. 
Removing the setTimeout changes the sum function’s behavior—it now executes step-by-step in the order written, rather than asynchronously.
